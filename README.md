# QR-Generator
A Python-based GUI tool to generate custom QR codes from URLs. It allows choosing eye patterns (square, circle, dotted, none) and body styles (default, dotted, lines). Users can also select custom colors for the QR body and background using a color palette. The generated QR is saved as fancy_qr.png automatically.
